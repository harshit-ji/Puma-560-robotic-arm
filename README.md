This was a Machine Design-I course project where we were divided into teams. Each team was given options from a list of mechanical robots. We had to choose one robot and manufacture it. We had to form a complete report about its manufacturing which include the preliminary calculations for its dimentions, stresses and load failures, fatigue testing, etc. That was the only necessary part but we went ahead and made a 3d Cad model for the arm based on our initial calculations. We then tested the model for the same conditions which was calculated in the preliminary design and the results were in good agreement with our initial caltulations. We then 3d printed the robot in parts and assembled it.
